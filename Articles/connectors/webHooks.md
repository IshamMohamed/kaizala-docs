# APIs to register & manage webhooks
## /webhook
API end-point to manage subscriptions to events inside Kaizala.

WebHooks is a lightweight HTTP pattern providing a simple publisher/subscriber model for wiring together Web APIs and SaaS services. When an event happens in Kaizala, a notification is sent in the form of an HTTP POST request to registered subscribers. The POST request contains information about the event which makes it possible for the receiver to act accordingly.


Using WebHooks, you can subscribe to various events that occur within a conversation group context in Kaizala.

### POST /webhook

    POST {endpoint-url}/v1/webhook

To ensure your webhook service endpoint is authentic and working we will verify your callback URL before creating subscription. For verification we will send you a validation token which you need to send us back within 5 seconds. [Read More](WebHookValidaton.md)
